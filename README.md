# Random Constructed

Constructed magic got boring when net decking became possible... Random Constructed is a format that makes constructed interesting again.

The code in this repository queries the Bitcoin Cash blockchain as the source of unbiased randomness used to pick 3 MTG sets from which to construct a deck of minimum 60 card with maximum 4 of each card.

The source of randomness comes from the hash of the first block mined after noon on Sunday. The new week's format is locked in from 4pm GMT on Sunday and lasts a week. A new tweet will be posted [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RandomConst) when the format changes. You can also [run the code yourself](https://repl.it/repls/TightInsubstantialBookmarks) to see what the current week's 3 sets are.

The number of combinations of three sets from the current 95 in the set list is 138415 so no net decking will be possible :D

Happy building!
